  I am usually open for debates as long as they remain civil. There is, unfortunately, a lot of misinformation going around about proshipping and false rumors spreading about proshippers based on preconceived notions, so if you have any questions don't be afraid to ask me and I will be happy to answer to the best of my abilities.
